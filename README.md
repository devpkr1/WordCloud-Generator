This project is a **Streamlit-based WordCloud Generator** that allows users to input text and visualize word clouds for unigrams and bigrams. It performs text preprocessing, including tokenization, stopword removal, and punctuation stripping, before generating the word clouds.

## Features
- Text preprocessing (lowercasing, tokenization, stopword removal, punctuation removal)
- Unigram and Bigram word cloud visualization
- Simple Streamlit UI for user interaction
